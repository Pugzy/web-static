> ## Gamemode and Format

This tournament will feature a mixed gamemode style, separated in 3 categories:

- Destroy (Destroy the Core and Destroy the Monument)
- Capture (Capture the Wool)
- Conquest (Team Deathmatch, King of the Hill, 5-Control Point and Capture the Flag)

The event will be Round-Robin with groups of 4 for the group stage while the invitational will be single elimination. Destroy and Capture matches will have a time limit of 45 minutes while Conquest matches will have a time limit of 12 minutes. As such, the Conquest gamemode will be a best of three.

In the event of a tie, a tiebreaker map will be played.

During the group stage, teams will play a veto-map to determine who vetoes gamemode and map first, teams will play one map per match and three matches per group

In the invitationals, teams will play all 3 gamemodes with maps being pre selected

When signing up, you must be prepared to play on the following dates:

**June 24 - 25:**  (Starting at 11:00 am EDT)

> ## Screensharing

In the past few tournaments on the Overcast Network, there was an influx of cheaters using modifications that were became ever harder to detect. To stop them we need an anti-cheat, which we do have a basic version of. But to ensure that we can run this event as free from cheaters as possible, we&#39;ve been forced to concede to using screensharing which has been requested by the community for quite some time.

For those who don&#39;t know, screensharing works by using a program that essentially streams the screen to us so we can check if players are cheating or not. We only use it if we really suspect someone is cheating and we can&#39;t prove with conventional means.

We are very much aware of the privacy issues that comes with screensharing though. If you&#39;re subjected to it, you will be the one in control and we&#39;ll only ask you to do stuff that could prove or disprove cheating, and we will only ever be looking to minecraft related files or folders, never other private stuff (ex. Browse history) that other servers may do.

> ## Rules

All teams must have at least 2 players who can speak English fluently present at all times so our referees can communicate with your team. Your entire team must stay in Discord for the duration of the match - the use of other voice communication software will not be allowed.
