After a bunch of work, we are proud to announce that `Private Servers` are ready to be released! These servers are purchasable through our [shop](https://stratusnetwork.buycraft.net/category/996763) and accessed through our lobby. As an initial sale, each server will start at **$5.99 for one month of *unlimited* use!** When purchasing a server, there are currently 3 customization options:

As of now, servers are brought up manually for the first time but will restart automatically if it goes down and does automatic restarts after 12 hours (unless a match is running). The player who purchases the server is the sole owner and given OP. They can give OP to other users, however the list will reset after restart. If you have any questions or run in to any problems, feel free to let us know!

Thanks for playing on Stratus and we hope you enjoy these private servers!
