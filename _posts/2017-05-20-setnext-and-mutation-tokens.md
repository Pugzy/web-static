Hello, we have a few pretty cool updates so let's get down to it!

Firstly, **setnext and mutation** tokens have been added to Stratus They've been on the server for a few days, but we've been working on ways to improve them and we now think they're ready. Tokens allow players to start a poll to set the next map or a mutation for the next match. Polls last 1 minute and during that time, players can use /vote yes or vote no in order to vote. If the poll goes through, a token will be used and the map/mutation will be set. If it doesn't, you get to keep the token but nothing will be set.

There are several ways to receive tokens. If you want to get them quick and help support the server financially you can purchase one of 3 token packages (or the 2 subscription packages which will be discussed later on):

<u class="ul">Stack of Tokens – | $2.99</u>
- 5 Setnext Tokens
- 5 Mutation Tokens

<u class="ul">Bag of Tokens – | $3.99</u>
- 10 Setnext Tokens
- 10 Mutation Tokens

<u class="ul">Box of Tokens – | $4.99</u>
- 15 Setnext Tokens
- 15 Mutation Tokens

The permanent ranks now offer tokens too (one time, not monthly)!

**Strato** = 3 of each tokens

**Alto** = 5 of each tokens

**Cirro** = 8 of each tokens

You can also buy tokens using droplets (which already serve more functionality than raindrops!):

**10k** droplets = 1 mutation token

**25k** droplets = 3 mutation tokens

**40k**  droplets = 5 mutation tokens

**15k**  droplets = 1 setnext token

**40k**  droplets = 3 setnext tokens

**65k**  droplets = 5 setnext tokens

Tokens are also occasionally awarded after a match. There is a 0.5% chance (individually) of winning a token after a match - 5% if you're **<u class="blue">MVP.</u>**

Speaking of **<u class="blue">MVP.</u>**, that is the last feature we want to talk about today! If you haven't noticed, there is an "**<u class="blue">MVP.</u>**" at the end of each match. As of now they are calculated based on objective completion, kills and deaths, however we plan on refining our formula in the future.
Lastly, we have 2 new ranks, **<u class="red">Stratus-</u>** and **<u class="green">Stratus+</u>** . Both of these are subscription based packages (meaning payments are monthly) which gives you access to some stuff on the main server as well as Cloudy. Here is all the information for each of the packages:

**<u class="ul"> <u class="red">Stratus-</u> | $2.49/month</u>**

_PGM server:_
- Cyan - on the PGM server
- 5 Setnext Tokens per month
- 10 Mutation Tokens per month

_Cloudy MapDev_
- [-]/ badge
- 1 extra world
- 
_More Coming Soon_

**<u class="ul"><u class="green">Stratus+</u> | $4.99/month</u>**

_PGM server:_
- Cyan + in game
- 15 Setnext Tokens per month
- 20 Mutation Tokens per month

_Cloudy MapDev:_
- [+] badge 
- 3 extra worlds
-

We still don't have an automated system for packages so it may take up to 24h before your rank/tokens are given
*subscription flairs are displayed before legacy rank flairs

To end off, we want to thank you all again for the support you have shown us and the server. We're steadily making progress to our 5000 player goal by Christmas!
