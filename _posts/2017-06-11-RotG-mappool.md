> ## Introduction

This event will feature a mixed gamemode style, including Destroy (DTC/M), Capture (CTW), and Conquest (TDM, KoTH, CTF, 5CP). Matches in the qualifiers will play Ping Bomb to determine the gamemode for the match, and for vetoing maps. In the invitationals maps for each gamemode will be predetermined, with Ping Bomb II being played to choose gamemode order. Matches in the invitationals will be played in a Best of Three.

CTW and DTC/M matches will last a maximum of 45 minutes. Conquest matches will have a time limit of ~12 minutes. As such, the Conquest gamemode will be  best of three maps. In the event of a tie, regardless of gamemode, Boom TE will be played in &quot;sudden death&quot; style.
