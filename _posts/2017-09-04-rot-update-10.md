The rotations have been updated once again for `/server Beta`! This is one of our biggest rotations yet with over half of the maps being removed and replaced with newer and fresher maps. To check the full changelong and new rotations, [click here](https://goo.gl/h5RzCq)

-------------------------------------------------------

As always, rotations may be subject to immediate change. Maps that have been added that do not play well may be replaced.

You may view the complete changes at the [Map-Rotations](https://github.com/stratusnetwork/map-rotations) repo and make a pull request if you wish to add/remove a map.(edited)
