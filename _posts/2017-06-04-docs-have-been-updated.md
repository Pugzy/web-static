http://docs.stratus.network/ has been updated! The changes are listed below:
- Added `Cloudy` guide [http://docs.stratus.network/guides/cloudy](http://docs.stratus.network/guides/cloudy)
- Added `Recommended Plugins` [http://docs.stratus.network/guides/plugins](Plugins http://docs.stratus.network/guides/plugins)
- Updated the References tab
- Added new proto (1.4.3 - anti blockglitch technology using Block 36)
- Revamped the Examples page [http://docs.stratus.network/examples/](http://docs.stratus.network/examples/)
The Examples page will be including examples for each gamemode as time goes on. We have a few right now, and more will be added later!

Also, with this update comes two new modules that will be documented later:
- Animations [http://docs.stratus.network/modules/animations](http://docs.stratus.network/modules/animations)
- MIDI Files [http://docs.stratus.network/modules/midi](http://docs.stratus.network/modules/midi)

Now, updating the docs isn't always an easy task. It takes a lot of time! We encourage users to help update the docs as frequently as possible as it is open-source & a community project.
