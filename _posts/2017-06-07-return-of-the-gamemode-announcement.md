Hello everyone! Stratus Network is excited to announce our first tournament, *Stratus: Return of the Gamemodes*!

First, we must announce that we are **delaying the tournament by the week.** We decided to do this in order to allow more time to finish organizing maps, and give teams more time to prepare. So, the tournament will take place on **June 24th-25th**, and **July 1st-2nd**.

### Format and Gamemode ###

The tournament will begin with a group stage which will be played on June 24th-25th, followed by a single elimination invitational on July 1st-2nd. There will be 8 teams in the invitational, with results from the group stage being used to seed teams.

The tournament will be mixed gamemode, including DTC/M (Destroy the Core/Monument), CTW (Capture the Wool), and Conquest. Conquest will consist of TDM (Team Deathmatch), CTF (Capture the Flag), and KoTH/5CP (King of the Hill/Control Points). In the group stage, a veto map will be played to choose vetoing order, and one gamemode will be played. In the invitational, all three gamemodes will be played, with a veto map being played to determine gamemode order. Conquest will be played as a best of 3 gamemode, with one TDM, CTF, and KoTH/5CP map being played.

### Team Information ###
We will be accepting up to 16 teams, with a maximum roster size of 12. Matches will be played 8v8, with teams requiring to have at least 6 players for a match. Registration for the tournament will be done using a Discord bot that Shiny is currently working on, which should be done by the end of the week.

Unfortunately, we **will not be able to provide private practice servers for the tournament.** However, in the following weeks some Sr. Refs will be hosting map testings and scrimmages on the Stratus dev server. Ideally, this will allow teams to practice for the tourney.

### Maps ###
While maps for the tournament haven&#39;t been fully decided yet, map tests will continue through the following weeks, and we expect to have a draft map pool ready by Sunday, June 11.

### Other Info ###
Additional information, including rules, further registration info, and more will be announced over the following week, so keep your eyes on the information channel.
