Hi Everyone!

We are pleased to announce that we have accepeted **17** teams into Return of the Gamemodes! The teams were split into 4 groups and, based on the availabilty form your team leader filed out, the teams are arranged into groups as follows:

_All times are in EDT (UTC-4)_

<u class="ul">Group A - Saturday June 24th 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM</u>
- Lucid
- Obey
- HeartClaw

<u class="ul">Group B - Saturday June 24th 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM</u>

As 17 does not go evenly into 4 groups, we have one group with **5** teams: <u class="ul">Group C</u>. Because of the added matches in Group C, the group will have an **extended playtime of 11 am to 4 pm**. Don't worry though as Group D is still schedule to start **on time** at **3pm**.
