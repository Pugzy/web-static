**How do I know when there is a new event?**

New events will be announced in #announcements channel in Discord as well as on the [http://stratus.network](http://stratus.network).

**How do I register my Minecraft account with my Discord account?**

Log on in game and register your Minecraft account with your Discord account by typing /discord register &lt;discord username&gt;. You will then be PM&#39;d a code in Discord. After you receive this code, copy it. Then do, /discord confirm &lt;code&gt;.

**How do I create a team?**

In order to create a team, make sure your Minecraft account and Discord account are registered and then join in game and type /discord team create &lt;team name&gt;.

**How do I invite a player to my team?**

To invite players to your team, make sure the players you are inviting to your team have registered their Minecraft account and Discord account. After you have done that, type /discord team invite &lt;username&gt;.

**How do I join a team?**

First, to let others know you are looking for a team, post to the &quot;LFT&quot; channel in the Stratus Tournament Discord. When your team leader has sent you an invitation to join the team, type /discord team accept &lt;team name&gt;. (Team name is case sensitive!)

**How do I leave a team?**

In order to leave a team, type /discord team leave.

Note: If the leader leaves the team, the team is disbanded.
**What should I know before I participate in an event?**

All of the details for the current event are posted in #announcement in Discord as well as on [](http://stratus.network). Read the information post and take note of the important dates and Team Information. Also be sure to read the network rules.

**How can I practice the tournament maps with my team?**

Before the tournament, we will have open scrims and map tests on &#39;/server tournament&#39;. We&#39;ll ping players in the Event Discord

**How do I talk to my teammates in the tournament?**

During the tournament we require teams to use a voice service called Discord. You must use Discord for your communication. On our Discord server rooms get setup when your team has more than 8 players.

**When should I be ready for my match?**

You should be ready and in discord 30 minutes before your match. Please stay undeafened when in discord so you can hear when a Referee comes to speak with you.

**What happens if I can&#39;t show up?**

If you can&#39;t show up, let your team know so they can tell us. If your team does not have enough players to play in the match, your team could be disqualified from the tournament and possibly blacklisted from playing in future tournaments.

**Where should I be before my match?**

Before your match you should be in the server lobby. You should also be in your team&#39;s Discord chanel, waiting for a Referee to join and tell you where you should go.

**How do I know where and when my match is starting?**

Throughout the tournament we will release information regarding the matches and you may find your team&#39;s name in the list of times and matchups. Around the time of your match, your room will be visited by a Referee who will then tell you to get on a server to prepare for your match.

**Can other teammates listen in our channel if they are not playing?**

Yes, however, they must stay muted.

**Can my non-playing teammates watch our live-stream?**

Yes, however, they must remain muted and they may not come in later as a substitute if you lose a player.

**Can I watch our matches live-stream while I play?**

No, absolutely not. Evidence of any actively playing member of your team watching the live-stream will result in a potential disqualification and blacklisting of your team.

**Can I go on the server and watch the matches?**

No, you may not. You may however, watch the live-streams at [https://www.twitch.tv/stratusmc](https://www.twitch.tv/stratusmc) when an event is in progress.
