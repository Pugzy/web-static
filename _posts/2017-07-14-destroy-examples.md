**Features**
- This map features lanes in the center that require bridging. The void regions that make this possible are available in the XML, and regions that are under <negative> will allow you to build in regions under it if void building is disabled.
- It also features kill rewards, where you get a golden apple and 12 arrows for each kill. 
- It also features regenerating iron blocks, where each time an iron block is broken, a new one regenerates at its place. 
- It also features portals, which it has two that take you straight to a bridge by the monument for easier access and to negate height advantage if the other team captures your hill where the objective is.
